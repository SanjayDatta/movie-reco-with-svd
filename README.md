# Movie recommendation using SVD
Following was one of Scalable Data Mining Assignments.
1. Load the MovieLens data and Convert the data into a matrix (for now, let it be dense)
2. (Optional: if the data is too big to handle, choose a subset of the ratings)
3. Leave out some non zero entries as a test set
4. Perform normalization 
5. Perform SVD
6. Compute the low rank ratings matrix according to the basic latent factor model
7. Test performance against the test data that is left out

First, download the data from: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/

Used 1M rating dataset
